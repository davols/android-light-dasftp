##TODOs
- Being able to have several sites saved
- Upload pictures from picasa, flickr etc.

###V1
V1 is supposed to be able to upload every picture (pending is picasa et al see #1)

###V2
V2 has more features, upload to several sites including imgur and several sftp sites. More settings.

For more todos see https://github.com/davols/android-light-dasftp/issues?state=open

Question is how to make it as simple as possible but also user-friendly and how many functions that should be implemented
First thought is imgur guest and then more sftp sites.
