android-light-dsftp
===================
Small simple upload picture to sftp server and give direct link in clipboard. Clean and light, just one key press (share and app)

##TODOs
- Home should link to shared pictures with thumbnail
- Being able to have several sites saved
- Error handling while uploading
- Icon

Question is how to make it as simple as possible but also user-friendly and how many functions that should be implemented
